I'm an AVID reader. I believe (and also advocate) that one can save a lot more time, in the long run, by reading the basics first (docs/introductory books) and then building on to more advanced concepts, rather than diving straight into programming and later scrounging for answers on StackOverflow.

Thus, whenever I feel there's something that would make me more effective in my work, I pick up a well-regarded book in that domain and try to understand its concepts from the ground up.

Below is a list of books grouped by topics that I have read in recent times and that I would recommend others to read ordered alphabetically by topic.

1. [Cloud Computing](cloud.md)
2. [DevOps](devops.md)
3. [Data Analysis](bd.md)
4. [Machine Learning](ml.md)
5. [Neuroscience and Exploratory AI](nea.md)
6. [Programming Languages](pl.md)

I do also read non-technical books at my leisure (ordered when I read them):

1. The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoevsky (2019)
2. Good To Great, Jim Collins (2019)
3. The Warrior Ethos, Steven Pressfield (2022)
4. The Art of Happiness, The Dalai Lama (2022)
5. Can't Hurt Me, David Goggins (2022)
6. The Lean Startup, Eric Ries (2023)
7. The Daily Stoic, Ryan Holiday (2023)
8. Psychology of Money, Morgan Housel (2023)
9. Never Finished, David Goggins (2023)
10. Zero To One, Peter Thiel (2024)
11. The Book of Five Rings, Miyamoto Musashi (Currently reading)
