title: "Readings (under construction)"
---

I'm an AVID reader. I believe (and also advocate) that one can save a lot more time, in the long run, by reading the basics first (docs/introductory books) and then building on to more advanced concepts, rather than diving straight into programming and later scrounging for answers on StackOverflow.

Thus, whenever I feel there's something that would make me more effective in my work, I pick up a well-regarded book in that domain and try to understand its concepts from the ground up.

Below is a list of books I have read in recent times, that I would recommend others to read, grouped by topics and ordered alphabetically.

1. [Cloud Computing](cloud.md)
2. [DevOps](cont.md)
3. [Data Analysis](bd.md)
4. [Machine Learning](ml.md)
5. [Neuroscience and Exploratory AI](nea.md)
6. [Programming Languages](pl.md)
