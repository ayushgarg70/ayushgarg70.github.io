I'm an AVID reader. I believe (and also advocate) that one can save a lot more time, in the long run, by reading the basics first (docs/introductory books) and then building on to more advanced concepts, rather than diving straight into programming and later scrounging for answers on StackOverflow.

Thus, whenever I feel there's something that would make me more effective in my work, I pick up a well-regarded book in that domain and try to understand its concepts from the ground up.

Below is a list of books, grouped by topic, that I have read in recent times and that I would recommend others to read (ordered alphabetically by topic).

1. [Cloud Computing](cloud.md)
2. [DevOps](devops.md)
3. [Data Analysis](bd.md)
4. [Machine Learning](ml.md)
5. [Neuroscience and Exploratory AI](nea.md)
6. [Programming Languages](pl.md)

I do also read [non-technical books](nontech.md) at my leisure.
